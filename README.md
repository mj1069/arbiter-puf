## Arbiter - Physically unclonable function
The Arbiter Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a security primitive that exploits the manufacturing variations in integrated circuits to produce unique digital fingerprints. It consists of a daisy chain of cross-bar switches, and its basic operation involves launching an input transition simultaneously into an upper and lower path, with the relative delay serving as the response. The design of PUFs depends on multiple device parameters, and an n-length Arbiter PUF can be treated as a Boolean function from {0,1}^n to {0,1}. The security aspects and composition of Arbiter PUFs have been the subject of comprehensive studies and analyses. They have been explored for various applications, including lightweight environments. The use of Arbiter PUFs in certain applications might be advantageous with the right constraints on the attack model. The literature provides mathematical models and statistical analyses to understand the behavior and properties of Arbiter PUFs.
